README files provide a snapshot of a repository. Professional README's leave a professional impression while unprofessional README's leave a poor impression. This application allows users to bootstrap a README template by answering a few quick questions in the CLI.

## <a name="motivation"></a> Motivation
[Contents](#contents)  
As a developer I always dreaded the monotonous task of writing README's. This process will get the README off the ground quickly and include some cool features such as the techology badges & the list of contributors.

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

`git clone` --> `npm i` --> `npm start`

One embarrassingly small hangup occurred when I tried to build the bulleted list of contributors. Joining the results array using `<br>` kept breaking the bullet points in markdown until I joined the array of contributors with `\n`.
